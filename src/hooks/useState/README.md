# useState

-- Use useState hook for state management in functional compoennts

-- I have added 3 different examples to demonstrate how to use this hook.

1. One is a basic way for using the useStte hook

2. Other one, I'm using useStae for making API call

3. And in the third one I have created my own custom form hook using useState.
